Chapter 1: Introduction to First Aid

First aid is the immediate care given to a person who has been injured or suddenly taken ill. It includes self-help and home care if medical assistance is not available or delayed.

Basic Principles:
- Preserve life
- Prevent further harm
- Promote recovery
- Provide comfort to the injured

The First Aid Approach:
1. Assess the situation
2. Make the area safe
3. Give emergency care
4. Get help

Chapter 2: Basic Life Support

Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR):
When someone is unresponsive and not breathing normally:

1. Check for responsiveness
   - Tap shoulders firmly
   - Shout "Are you okay?"

2. Call for help
   - Call emergency services
   - Ask for an AED if available

3. Check for breathing
   - Look for chest movement
   - Listen for breath sounds
   - Feel for breath on your cheek

4. Begin chest compressions
   - Place heel of hand on center of chest
   - Push hard and fast at least 2 inches deep
   - Allow complete chest recoil
   - Compress at rate of 100-120 per minute

5. Give rescue breaths
   - Tilt head back, lift chin
   - Pinch nose closed
   - Give 2 breaths, each lasting 1 second
   - Watch for chest rise with each breath

6. Continue CPR
   - 30 compressions followed by 2 breaths
   - Continue until emergency services arrive

Chapter 3: Wound Care and Bleeding Control

Severe Bleeding:
1. Apply direct pressure
   - Use clean cloth or gauze
   - Press firmly over the wound
   - Do not remove embedded objects

2. Elevate if possible
   - Raise injured area above heart level
   - Only if no fracture suspected

3. Apply pressure bandage
   - Wrap firmly but not too tight
   - Check circulation below bandage

4. Monitor for shock
   - Keep person lying down
   - Cover to maintain body temperature
   - Reassure and monitor breathing

Minor Cuts and Scrapes:
1. Clean your hands
2. Stop the bleeding with direct pressure
3. Clean the wound with water
4. Apply antibiotic ointment if available
5. Cover with sterile bandage
6. Change bandage daily

Chapter 4: Burns and Scalds

Thermal Burns:
1. Cool the burn
   - Use cool (not cold) running water
   - Cool for 10-20 minutes
   - Remove from heat source

2. Remove jewelry and loose clothing
   - Do this quickly before swelling occurs
   - Do not remove stuck clothing

3. Cover the burn
   - Use sterile gauze or clean cloth
   - Do not use ice, butter, or ointments
   - Do not break blisters

4. Seek medical attention for:
   - Burns larger than palm of hand
   - Burns on face, hands, feet, or genitals
   - Chemical or electrical burns
   - Signs of infection

Chapter 5: Fractures and Sprains

Suspected Fracture:
1. Do not move the person unless in danger
2. Support the injured area
3. Immobilize above and below injury
4. Apply ice wrapped in cloth
5. Monitor circulation
6. Seek immediate medical attention

Sprains:
Remember RICE:
- Rest: Avoid activities that cause pain
- Ice: Apply for 15-20 minutes every 2-3 hours
- Compression: Use elastic bandage (not too tight)
- Elevation: Raise above heart level when possible

Chapter 6: Poisoning and Overdose

General Poisoning:
1. Identify the poison if possible
2. Call Poison Control: 1-800-222-1222
3. Follow their instructions exactly
4. Do not induce vomiting unless told to do so
5. If person is unconscious, place in recovery position
6. Monitor breathing and pulse

Drug Overdose:
1. Call emergency services immediately
2. Try to identify the substance
3. Check breathing and pulse
4. If unconscious but breathing, place in recovery position
5. Be prepared to perform CPR
6. Stay with person until help arrives

Chapter 7: Environmental Emergencies

Heat Exhaustion:
Signs: Heavy sweating, weakness, nausea, headache
Treatment:
1. Move to cool area
2. Remove excess clothing
3. Apply cool water to skin
4. Give cool water to drink if conscious
5. Monitor temperature

Heat Stroke:
Signs: High temperature, altered mental state, hot dry skin
Treatment:
1. Call emergency services immediately
2. Cool aggressively with ice packs
3. Monitor airway and breathing
4. Do not give fluids

Hypothermia:
Signs: Shivering, confusion, drowsiness
Treatment:
1. Move to warm area
2. Remove wet clothing
3. Wrap in blankets
4. Give warm drinks if conscious
5. Handle gently

Chapter 8: Medical Emergencies

Heart Attack:
Signs: Chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, sweating
Treatment:
1. Call emergency services
2. Help person sit comfortably
3. Give aspirin if not allergic
4. Monitor breathing and pulse
5. Be prepared for CPR

Stroke:
Use FAST assessment:
- Face: Facial drooping
- Arms: Arm weakness
- Speech: Speech difficulty
- Time: Time to call emergency services

Seizures:
1. Protect from injury
2. Do not restrain
3. Time the seizure
4. Place in recovery position after seizure
5. Call emergency services if first seizure or lasts >5 minutes

Chapter 9: Psychological First Aid

Basic Principles:
1. Ensure safety and comfort
2. Stabilize if agitated
3. Gather information about needs
4. Offer practical assistance
5. Connect with social supports
6. Provide coping information
7. Respect cultural differences

Approach:
- Listen actively
- Show empathy
- Provide accurate information
- Help with practical needs
- Respect person's decisions

Chapter 10: Training and Education

Regular training is essential for maintaining first aid skills.
Practice scenarios regularly and stay updated on guidelines.

Remember: First aid is not medical treatment. Always seek professional medical care for serious injuries or illnesses.

Emergency Contacts:
- Emergency Services: 911 (or local emergency number)
- Poison Control: 1-800-222-1222
- Local Hospital Emergency Department

5. Additional Resources

Chapter 1: What is Psychological First Aid?

Psychological first aid (PFA) is a humane, supportive response to a fellow human being who is suffering and who may need support.

PFA involves three key action principles:
1. Look - Check for safety and people with obvious urgent basic needs
2. Listen - Approach people who may need support and ask about their needs
3. Link - Help people address basic needs and access services

Key Features of PFA:
- Consistent with research evidence on risk and resilience
- Applicable and practical in field settings
- Appropriate for developmental levels across the lifespan
- Culturally informed and delivered in a flexible manner
- Does not necessarily require mental health professionals
- Aimed at reducing initial distress and fostering adaptive functioning

Chapter 2: When to Use Psychological First Aid

PFA is for people recently exposed to a serious stressor event. This could include:

Natural Disasters:
- Earthquakes, floods, hurricanes
- Wildfires, tornadoes, tsunamis

Human-Caused Events:
- Mass violence, terrorism
- Serious accidents
- Sudden death of loved one

Community Disruptions:
- Disease outbreaks
- Displacement from home
- Loss of services or support

Signs Someone May Need Support:
- Appears confused or disoriented
- Seems very upset or agitated
- Is unusually quiet or withdrawn
- Has difficulty communicating
- Shows signs of physical distress

Chapter 3: How to Provide Psychological First Aid

The PFA Action Principles:

LOOK:
- Check for safety
- Check for people with obvious urgent basic needs
- Check for people with serious distress reactions

Safety Considerations:
- Is the immediate environment safe?
- Are there ongoing threats to safety?
- Are there people who are injured and need medical attention?
- Are there people who cannot care for themselves?

LISTEN:
- Approach people who may need support
- Ask about people's needs and concerns
- Listen to people and help them feel calm

How to Approach Someone:
- Introduce yourself and your role
- Ask permission before sitting or moving closer
- Be honest about your availability
- Respect people's privacy and right to refuse help

Active Listening:
- Give the person your full attention
- Listen with patience and compassion
- Stay calm and be aware of your own reactions
- Reflect back what you hear
- Ask questions to better understand their experience

LINK:
- Help people address basic needs and access services
